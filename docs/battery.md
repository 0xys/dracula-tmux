# battery display

Display any icon for the battery you'd like with:
`set -g @dracula-battery-label "put_your_label_here"`

Alternatively set:
```
set -g @dracula-battery-label false
set -g @dracula-show-battery-status true
```
Which will display the battery charge and whether its charging (or just drawing from AC) as nerdfont icons.
